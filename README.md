# playlist_transfer-gtk
Graphical wrapper for playlist_transfer utility

Just a simple quickly created graphical wrapper for my helper tool [playlist_transfer](https://github.com/Kisuke-CZE/playlist_transfer)

My first GUI. I realize I probaly did many things wrong here, but it does the job somehow. Created this GUI for my father, who just wanted to do same thing as I am doing with playlist_transfer, but terminal is not so friendly for him.

## Requirements
- Installed ruby
- Installed gtk3 gem
- Installed playlist_transfer gem (with it's dependecies)
